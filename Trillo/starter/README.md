# Following Advanced CSS and SASS Udemy Course

## Good advice for 2019

Per this [comment](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/learn/lecture/8274482#questions/6330752), skip implementing _Natours_ in **floats**, and instead learn first about **flex boxes** in _Trillo_ project. Then come back to _Natours_, follow it, learn about **floats**, but, implement it in **flex boxes** instead.

## How to use

First we need to install dependencies by running in terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, to start a development environment that will auto-compile _Sass_ and auto reload page, run:

```bash
npm start
```

## Notes

1. I'm using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), a zero-config build system that takes care of compiling _Sass_ and page reload instead of a way that course author solved the same problem.
2. Also, _Sass_ code is broken down in accordance with the [7-1 pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern)
